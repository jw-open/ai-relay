# ai-relay

> WebSocket relay that bridges AI coding agent CLIs (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Snowflake Cortex, and more) to any web interface — stream reasoning, tool calls, and file changes in real time.

## Install

```bash
pip install ai-relay
```

## Quick start

### One-shot mode (local dev)

```bash
# Start the relay server (default: ws://0.0.0.0:8765)
ai-relay --port 8765
```

### Server mode (container / daemon)

```bash
# Persistent server — each WebSocket connection becomes one independent agent session
ai-relay serve --port 9000
```

Then connect from OhWise Lab (or any WebSocket client) and send a handshake:

```json
{"tool": "claude", "folder": "/path/to/project", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6"}
```

The relay streams structured JSON events over WebSocket and forwards your messages to the selected backend. Claude Code and Gemini use native JSONL process protocols, Codex uses the app-server JSON-RPC protocol, and Snowflake Cortex uses HTTP/SSE. The PTY bridge is retained only for generic/legacy CLI tools.

## Running in a container

`ai-relay serve` is designed to run inside a Docker container as a persistent daemon:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
RUN pip install ai-relay
# Install your AI CLI here (e.g. npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code)
CMD ["ai-relay", "serve", "--port", "9000"]
```

Each incoming WebSocket connection spawns an independent agent session. Multiple clients can connect simultaneously.

### Recommended architecture (enterprise-grade SaaS)

For a multi-tenant, production SaaS, the **recommended design** is:

- **One isolated compute boundary per tenant/user** (the isolation boundary) — use whatever fits your needs: a VM, pod, container, serverless/Lambda sandbox, dedicated server, or on-prem host. Each runs **one** `ai-relay serve` that **multiplexes all of that tenant's sessions** — one WebSocket connection per `session_id`. Never share one runtime across tenants, and do not start one process per session.
- **A server-side orchestrator/hub in front** (never expose ai-relay to the browser): it holds one WebSocket per session to the relay, fans out to N browser tabs, enforces auth/RBAC, persists conversation history + state in a database, and **keeps the connection open so in-progress turns survive a browser refresh**.
- **Per-tenant filesystem isolation + dropped capabilities + internal-only networking.**

ai-relay is the stateless streaming engine; durability and multi-tenancy live in your orchestrator. Full reference architecture and rationale: **[docs/architecture.md → Session multiplexing model / Recommended architecture](docs/architecture.md#session-multiplexing-model)**.

## Event types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `session_start` | Process spawned |
| `session_end` | Process exited (includes exit_code) |
| `stdout` / `stderr` | Raw output lines |
| `reasoning` | Agent thinking/planning text |
| `tool_call` | Agent invoking a tool (Read, Edit, Bash…) |
| `tool_result` | Result of a tool call |
| `file_diff` | File created or edited |
| `response` | Final answer text |
| `assistant_message` | Native structured assistant message |
| `user_message` | Native structured user/tool-result message |
| `stream_event` | Native streaming event |
| `status` | Native status/control event |
| `permission_request` | Tool permission prompt from a structured backend |
| `permission_cancelled` | Pending permission prompt was cancelled |
| `control_response` | Native control response acknowledgment |
| `tool_progress` | Native tool progress event |
| `quota_warning` | API quota / rate limit detected |
| `context_warning` | Context window nearing limit (includes context_pct) |
| `context_compacted` | Context was compacted |
| `error` | Relay or process error |
| `input_ack` | Relay confirms your message was sent to the process |

## Sending commands

Send JSON over WebSocket:

```json
{"text": "refactor the authentication module to use JWT"}
```

Claude Code also accepts structured web-client messages:

```json
{"type": "user_message", "content": "refactor the authentication module to use JWT"}
```

Permission responses:

```json
{"type": "permission_response", "request_id": "req", "behavior": "allow", "updatedInput": {"command": "git status"}}
```

Codex permission responses can also use:

```json
{"type": "permission_response", "request_id": "req", "allow": true}
```

Interrupt the active structured turn:

```json
{"type": "interrupt"}
```

Codex uses `codex app-server --listen stdio://` and keeps a persistent thread behind the WebSocket session:

```json
{"tool": "codex", "folder": "/path/to/project", "model": "gpt-5.2"}
```

Gemini CLI uses ACP (Agent Communication Protocol) mode. Each text message starts one Gemini turn:

```json
{"tool": "gemini", "folder": "/path/to/project", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash"}
```

> **Gemini-specific behavior — per-turn process lifecycle**
>
> Unlike Claude Code (persistent process + `--resume`) and Codex (persistent
> app-server), Gemini CLI ACP mode (≥ 0.40.x) exits the subprocess after every
> `session/prompt` turn completes (exit code 0). This is by design in the Gemini
> CLI implementation.
>
> The relay handles this transparently:
> - On the first turn the relay calls `session/new` and saves the returned
>   `sessionId` to `.gemini_acp_session` in the session working folder.
> - On each subsequent reconnect the relay calls `session/load` with that ID so
>   Gemini restores conversation context in the new process.
> - If `session/load` fails (session expired or folder was wiped) the relay
>   falls back to `session/new` automatically.
>
> **Implication for permission approvals:** because the process exits after each
> turn, permission responses must be sent while the current turn's process is
> still alive (i.e. before the `session/prompt` RPC completes). The default
> `session/prompt` timeout is 5 minutes, which covers typical interactive
> permission dialogs.

Snowflake Cortex uses API configuration in the handshake.

Cortex chat mode:

```json
{
  "tool": "cortex",
  "mode": "chat",
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5",
  "snowflake": {
    "account_url": "https://<account>.snowflakecomputing.com",
    "token_env": "SNOWFLAKE_PAT"
  }
}
```

Cortex Analyst mode:

```json
{
  "tool": "cortex",
  "mode": "analyst",
  "snowflake": {
    "account_url": "https://<account>.snowflakecomputing.com",
    "token_env": "SNOWFLAKE_PAT",
    "semantic_view": "DB.SCHEMA.VIEW"
  }
}
```

To send CLI commands (e.g. `/compact`, `/clear`):

```json
{"text": "/compact"}
```
